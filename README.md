# AddUsersPowershellScript
A simple script to add AD-Users to a windows server.

In this example, the server would be for a student account system at a school. The idea is that you will be given a daily csv file (to be entered as an argument when executing the script) with all changes to the students' schedules. I chose to use the postal code attribute to keep track of the total number of classes for each student.
